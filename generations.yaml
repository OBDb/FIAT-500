    description: "The original Fiat 500, known as the Nuova 500, was a rear-engine, four-seat city car designed by Dante Giacosa. Measuring just 2.97 meters long, it epitomized the concept of the 'city car' with its compact dimensions and fuel efficiency. Powered by a tiny 479cc two-cylinder engine producing just 13 HP, it prioritized economy over performance. The design featured a distinctive bubble-like shape with suicide doors (replaced by conventional doors in later models), a canvas sunroof, and minimal interior amenities. Despite its simplicity, the original 500 became an icon of Italian design and mobility, helping to motorize post-war Italy with over 3.6 million units produced. Various versions were developed during its production, including the more powerful 500 Sport, the station wagon 500 Giardiniera, and the 500L with luxury features."

    description: "The modern Fiat 500 was introduced on the 50th anniversary of the original model, featuring retro-inspired styling that evoked the 1957 version but with contemporary engineering and safety features. Built on Fiat's Mini platform shared with the Panda, it maintained compact dimensions but with significantly more interior space and comfort than its predecessor. Initially powered by a range of small gasoline and diesel engines, including the 1.4L 16v with 100 HP in the Sport variant, the engine lineup evolved over time to include more efficient turbocharged options like the TwinAir and MultiAir units. The interior combined vintage-inspired design elements with modern technology, featuring a body-colored dashboard panel and circular design motifs. A significant mid-life facelift in 2016 brought updated styling, improved infotainment, and enhanced safety features. Special variants have included the performance-oriented Abarth models, the 500C with a retractable fabric roof, and numerous limited and special editions featuring designer collaborations. Production ended in August 2024 in Poland, after 17 years of continuous production. Throughout its production, the modern 500 has maintained its essence as a fashionable, premium small car that successfully reinterpreted a classic design for contemporary consumers."
